            <p><h3>I am an Engineer, having aspiration to engineer some of the world's hardest problems.</h3>
             My Ultimate aspiration is to Build and run at least one fortune 500 AI/AGI Company.</p>
             <h2 style="background-color: white; color: black;">Purpose of Building and Running AI Company</h2>
             <p>Objective of building Powerful AI or AGI is not to eliminate humans or replace humans. 
                It is the ridiculous idea and Leadership in AI/AGI often get wrong ideas about
                building the systems who can autonomously work beside humans. To work Autonomously It needs precise decision making,
                imagination and thinking which we took <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination#:~:text=The%20most%20advanced%20mechanism%20of%20imagination%2C%20prefrontal%20synthesis%2C%20was%20likely%20acquired%20by%20humans%20around%2070%2C000%20years%20ago%20and%20resulted%20in%20behavioral%20modernity.%5B40">70,000</a> Years to develop. We are so good at thinking
                imagination and decision making that we nearly thought impossible in the past years and will continue.

                In fact we like to think, imagine and make decisions but there main problem is that we are part of 
                two distinct world.Mental and physical world. Where mental world works very fast and adapts the changes quickly.
                On the other hand physical world that work way slower we think. The frustration lies in making the harmony between both World.
The purpose of building the Powerful AI or AGI to make the physical world more agile and more adaptable and facilities us to create and test and destroy our product of vision and imagination</p>

                <p>Crafting Quiz with Gemini AI on any Subject, any No. of Questions or without subject matter expertise.</p>
                <p><h3 style="color: white;">Problem Statement</h3>I have realized that There are lots of people who often have requirements to create the Quiz with limited time and resources. The problem statement is that we need to create application which facilitates quiz creation without human intervention and expert or specialized knowledge. Let's understand problem in more detail by an example. Let say you have requirements to create the Quiz of 20 question, 4 choices for each question. So how much work you need to do. First of all . You have to figure out 20 unique questions. And. Then you have think about 80 choices in which 20 are correct and 60 incorrect. It is quite easy for someone to figure out the correct choice. But Here comes the trickiest part, figuring out incorrect choices are much trickier than correct choices. Why? because this is the only thing which captures the confidence and knowledge of the candidate who makes decisions or series of decision to figure out the correct choice among all the choices.</p>
